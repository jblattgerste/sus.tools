# sus.tools website

This repository hosts the website https://sus.tools through GitHub Pages. It only serves as the source and deployment location for the homepagesâ€™s static content. It's intended solely for hosting purposes and does not contain additional content of interest. The source code of the tools of the System Usability Scale Analysis Toolkit themselves can be found [in my other repositories](https://github.com/jblattgerste?tab=repositories).
